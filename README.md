# CS-340-Client-ServerDevelopment

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Using coding best pratice, by making sure I commented my code, use the proper formatting when writing code and that my logic is proper for 
what I am working.  Using the right sintax and logic can help me build reusable code that can help me future proyect. When writing commenting the code can help too to know what are we doing, that way when we come back to the code for reusing or maintaining you know where to go exactly. This can help debug our code too. Since this CRUD module is use to connect the data base to our interface, we can modify what we need from it and use it for others projects. 


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My approach is similar in different situations. As a computer scientist we need to solve porblems and find ways to implement that problem the best way possible. This mean we can get to the same result in different ways, we always have to use the right one, not always the better one. For database this is something completely new to me, I would like to learn others implementation and databases to find which one suit better at the moment of creating new database. In MongoDB, since we worked with Python, I found Python easy to manage and to build in it.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientist use computer systems to identify, analyze and find solution the complex problems. This come hand to hand with creating and developing new software/programs. I have to add that designing the software is part of the job and we need to find through experiments and research what are going to be doing and how is the best way to get to our solution. This is not only in software, we imporve hardware and technology overall.
Our job in this project can help companies by organizing theirs data, providing them a way to access their data in a faster and effective way, plus saving time, money and resources.
